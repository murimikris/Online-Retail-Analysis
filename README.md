#### Top Selling and High Revenue Products

The analysis of product popularity shows specific items driving the majority of quantities sold and revenue. These bestsellers and high-revenue generators are crucial for targeted advertising and stock prioritization. The top selling products are: Assorted colour bird ornament, lunch bag red retrospot, jumbo bag red retrospot, lunch bag black skull and, jam making set printed. Bags are the top selling product accounting for 6 of the top 10 sales.

The top revenue earners for the store include a jumbo bag red retrospot, White hanging heart t-light holder, Assorted colour bird ornament, Lunch bag red retrospot and Jam making set with jars. There is some overlap between the top sales products and the top revenue earners. Bags make up 3 of the top ten revenue earners, setting them apart as the best-performing commodity for the business.

#### Sales Quantity Correlation with Pricing
An analysis of the relationship between unit price and sales indicates a slight negative correlation. This reveals that as unit price increases, sales slightly decrease. Products at a lower price point sell more than products at higher price points.

#### Day of the Week Analysis
Sales performance by day of the week shows variability, with some days significantly outperforming others. Weekends have the lowest sales in the week. This is likely impacted by the business being closed on Saturday. Customers may assume that the business is closed all weekend as it is more common for stores to be closed on Sunday instead.

The business makes more sales in the midweek with Tuesday, Wednesday and, Thursday enjoying the highest sales of the week.

#### Price Distribution Across Countries

An exploration of prices across countries reveals that Brazil, which is one of the poorest-performing countries in sales, has the highest pricing. The lowest price point in Brazil is about the median price in all other regions. This shows inflated pricing in Brazil and may be a contributing factor to the poor performance of that market. This suggests opportunities for price optimization based on regional market dynamics.

### Recommendations

1. Optimize Inventory and Marketing for Seasonal Peaks
Increase Stock Before Peak Months: Given the significant sales increase from September to November, it's crucial to stock up on inventory ahead of these months. Ensure popular items, especially bestsellers are readily available.
Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Launch targeted marketing campaigns to capitalize on the seasonal peak. Promotions, discounts, and special offers during these months can further boost sales.

2. Leverage High-Performing Markets
Focus on the United Kingdom and Western Europe: Since the UK and other Western European countries (Germany, France, Ireland, and Spain) are the primary revenue sources, continue to nurture these markets with region-specific marketing strategies and customer engagement initiatives.
Expand Market Presence: Explore opportunities to expand market presence in other potential high-value regions. Conduct market research to understand local preferences and adapt strategies accordingly.

3. Improve Performance in Low-Sales Regions
Adjust Pricing Strategies in Brazil: The analysis indicates that Brazil has significantly higher prices, which may be contributing to its poor sales performance. Consider revising pricing strategies to make products more competitively priced in this market.
Localized Promotions: Implement localized promotions and marketing campaigns in low-performing regions to stimulate demand and increase sales.

4. Capitalize on Top Selling and High Revenue Products
Promote Top Sellers: Focus marketing efforts on top-selling items such as assorted color bird ornaments, lunch bags, and jam-making sets. Highlight these products in advertising campaigns and feature them prominently on the website.
Enhance Stock Levels: Ensure sufficient stock levels for these high-demand items to prevent stockouts and lost sales opportunities.

5. Adjust Pricing Strategies to Boost Sales Volume
Price Adjustments: Given the slight negative correlation between price and sales volume, consider implementing price adjustments for high-priced items to make them more attractive to price-sensitive customers. Evaluate the impact of price changes through A/B testing to find the optimal pricing strategy.

6. Improve Sales Performance Throughout the Week
Weekend Sales Strategy: Since weekends have the lowest sales, consider introducing special weekend promotions or discounts to attract customers. Communicate clearly that the store is open on Sundays to dispel any misconceptions.
Maximize Mid-Week Sales: Continue to leverage the high sales during mid-week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) by running mid-week specials or flash sales to maintain and boost sales momentum.

By implementing these recommendations, the online retail store can enhance its operational efficiency, better meet customer needs, and ultimately drive higher sales and profitability. Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on ongoing data analysis will ensure these strategies remain effective and relevant in a dynamic market environment.


### Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis provides actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions to enhance the store's overall performance. By focusing on data-driven decisions, the retail store can optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability in the competitive online retail market. Further analysis could delve into customer segmentation, predictive modelling for sales forecasting, and deeper analysis of customer purchase patterns to refine these recommendations.
